# jupiter-wind-speeds
Code to compute the zonal wind speed based on Hubble Space Telescope images that uses correlation method develovped by Xylar Asay-Davis (2011, et al.) to compute the zonal wind speed on planets. Code intitally ported to Matlab by Josh Tollefson (2017, et al.) and ported to python by Druv Punjabi (dhp@berkeley.edu). 

Developments needed: 
* Current model depends on images having the same latitude range 
* Code requires speeding up through parallelization
